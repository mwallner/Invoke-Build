## Custom tasks

Custom tasks may be defined literally and via custom parameters, see [Repeat](Repeat) and [Repeat2](Repeat2).

- [Check](Check) shows the custom task `check` which is invoked once even if a build (check list) is invoked repeatedly.
- [File](File) shows the custom task `file`, an incremental task with simplified syntax, somewhat similar to Rake's `file`.
- [Repeat](Repeat) shows the custom task `repeat` which is invoked periodically in a build script (schedule) with such tasks.
- [Repeat2](Repeat2) shows the alternative way with using the special command `repeat` which turns tasks into repeatable.
- [RepeatRedis](RepeatRedis) is similar to `Repeat2` but it uses Redis for task records instead of CLIXML files.
- [Retry](Retry) shows the custom task `retry` which retries its action on failures several times depending on parameters.
